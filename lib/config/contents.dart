    ''' Two months after signing his contract, Sergio Ramos still hasn't made his debut with PSG and he isn't expected to until 22 September in the league game against Metz. Former player Jerôme Rothen, who is currently working as a pundit for RMC Sport, has criticised the decision to sign the Spanish centre-back, who arrived on a free transfer in July days after his contract at Real Madrid had expired.
"Sustaining a calf muscle injury towards the end of your career is really bad news because it's an injury that you seldom make a full recovery from… Once the player increases his rhythm, whether during a game or in training with PSG, he might not be able to continue…And when a player reaches a certain age, he needs to play a number of games to get back into form. Will he be able to get back to top level if he has constant pains to his calf? I have serious doubts about that," Rothen said on RMC Sport.
He went on to add: "When he arrived, everyone said that Sergio Ramos was going to change the mentality inside the dressing room. But today, Marquinhos and Kimpembe are way above Ramos in terms of influence. His motivational skills aren't enough right now at PSG. He needs to be bringing more to the team out on the field of play. If he's unable to do that, then there is no point in having him. That's why I get the feeling that signing Ramos was a bad idea for PSG".

    ''' Gunmen have reportedly fired upon soldiers and freed hundreds of prisoners in Kogi State, northern Nigeria.
Ayuba Edeh, the assistant inspector-general of Police Zone 8, has reportedly said the state commissioner of police and other heads of security agencies are now attempting to regain control at the scene. Newsweek has contacted Edeh for further comment.
The jailbreak is thought to have occurred at a medium-security federal correctional center in Kabba.
In as-yet unverified reports, local media outlet Vanguard states gunmen numbering "in their tens" led the attack against the prison center, situated on the Lokoja highway.
The armed prison break operation is thought to have commenced on Sunday night and lasted through to Monday morning, resulting in the deaths of an unspecified number of military men guarding the perimeter, before attacking the center itself.
The gunmen, whose motivation at this time remains unclear, are thought to have next targeted the prison officers before proceeding to "set all the prisoners free," Vanguard reported.
The audacious plan is thought to have been assisted by unseasonably heavy rain early on Monday morning, leading to the prison complex housing the inmates reportedly "submerged by floods."
Several local media outlets, which have also been contacted by Newsweek, have reported approximately 100 of the inmates freed by the gunmen have since been rearrested.
Minister of Interior Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola said in a statement on Monday: "During the attack, security officers on duty which comprised of 15 soldiers, 10 police officers and 10 armed guards of the NCoS [Nigeria Correctional Service] on duty fought gallantly to repel the attack.
"Regrettably, two officers of the Correctional Service are yet to be accounted for, while one soldier and a policeman lost their lives during the attack."
He added the Kabba Custodial facility had 294 inmates as at the time of the attack, many of whom escaped after the gunmen used explosives to destroy three sides of the perimeter fence.
Some 28 inmates did not escape, while some have also voluntarily returned to the facility this morning.
One uncorroborated photo has emerged on social media showing a man appearing to stand guard looking through a large hole knocked through the wall of the prison.
The poster of the picture, who Newsweek has contacted, has added the wholly unsubstantiated caption "Fulani bandits kill soldiers on duty, set all prisoners free in Kogi prisons."

    '''  The Jennifer's Body actor stepped out in a sheer Mugler gown with nothing but a silver thong underneath, which she paired with gold pumps. The dress featured sparkly embroidery and created an optical illusion with dark mesh, so that her underwear no longer showed through when Fox turned to the side, showing off her silhouette. She also wore her a wet hairstyle that gave the entire look a "just awoken mermaid" vibe.
Fox posed on the red carpet alongside her boyfriend, Machine Gun Kelly, who is performing at tonight's awards. The "Bloody Valentine" rapper wore a glittery red pinstriped suit with a matching shirt, black dress shoes, and silver facial jewelry.
The Transformers actor has been dating the rapper since the spring of 2020, when they met on the set of their film Midnight in the Switchgrass. The couple recently sparked engagement rumors when Fox was spotted wearing what looked like the ring while watching Kelly's VMA rehearsal Wednesday.
Though a rep for the couple told Page Six that they are not engaged, Fox said last year that she had an instant connection with Kelly when they met, per Entertainment Tonight.
"I knew right away that he was what I call a twin flame," she said. "Instead of a soul mate, a twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time. So we're actually two halves of the same soul, I think. And I said that to him almost immediately, because I felt it right away.''';

    ''' Jennifer Aniston is laughing off the dating rumors between herself and her Friends co-star, David Schwimmer, that popped up shortly after the sitcom's HBO Max reunion special aired back in May. 
During a junket for her Apple TV+ series, The Morning Show, Aniston, 52, addressed the rumors with ET's Rachel Smith and her Morning Show co-star, Reese Witherspoon. 
"That was bizarre. I could not believe that, actually. Like, really? That's my brother," she told ET of Schwimmer, 54. "But I understand it, though. It just shows you how hopeful people are for fantasies for dreams to come true."
Reps for both Aniston and Schwimmer have previously denied the dating rumors. The rumors circulated after the co-stars confirmed that they each harbored a mutual crush on one another while filming their characters Rachel and Ross on the beloved sitcom. 
"The first season, we-- I had a major crush on Jen," Schwimmer said during the reunion, to which Aniston replied, "It was reciprocated." 
"At some point, we were both crushing hard on each other," Schwimmer continued. "But it was like two ships passing, because one of us was always in a relationship. And we never crossed that boundary. We respected that."
The reunion special picked up four Emmy nominations, which Aniston told ET was not expected. 
"It's very exciting, and it was, kind of, not even expected," she said. "We're in the same category as Hamilton, so that's the closest I'll get to a Broadway show. But yes, that was a nice surprise." 
Witherspoon, who played Aniston's on-screen sister for several episodes of the sitcom, also commented on the impact of Friends in her own life while speaking with ET. 
"I cried three times watching you guys," she said of the reunion. "It reminds me of a time in my life. So y'all lived it, but we watched it, and it was important to me. I remember having a little baby and being a mom and you guys were my friends."
